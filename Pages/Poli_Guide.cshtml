                The University is committed to fostering an inclusive, ethical, and academically rigorous environment. All members of our community—students, faculty, and staff—are expected to adhere to the following principles:

                Academic Integrity: Honesty in research, coursework, and examinations is mandatory. Plagiarism, cheating, or any form of academic misconduct will result in disciplinary action.

                Diversity & Inclusion: We uphold equal opportunities for all, regardless of race, gender, religion, or background. Discrimination or harassment is strictly prohibited.

                Respectful Conduct: Professional and respectful behavior is required in classrooms, offices, and campus spaces. Disruptive or harmful actions will not be tolerated.

                Compliance with Laws: The university adheres to local, national, and international laws, including data protection (e.g., GDPR) and health/safety regulations.

                Freedom of Expression: While encouraging open dialogue, speech must align with principles of mutual respect and institutional values.

                Sustainability: Campus operations prioritize environmental responsibility, including waste reduction and energy conservation.

                Violations of these policies may lead to sanctions, including probation, suspension, or expulsion. For full details, refer to the [University Code of Conduct] or contact the Office of Student Affairs.
